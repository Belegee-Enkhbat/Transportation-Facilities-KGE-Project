Purpose statement:
To create a reusable knowledge graph that accurately represents the network of bus routes in 
Ulaanbaatar city. This involves connecting various bus stops throughout the city to establish a 
visualization of the public transportation system. By connecting these routes and stops, the 
knowledge graph will serve as a valuable resource for urban planners, public transportation 
planners for decision making, optimizing routes, and enhancing overall efficiency and accessibility 
within Ulaanbaatarâ€™s transportation system.
