Purpose statement: To create a reusable knowledge graph that represents bus routes by connecting bus stops.
- Neg hun neg gazraas nuguu gazr luu hamgiin hurdan bus aar ywah

Scenarios:
1. Planning Bus Routes: Someone who plans bus routes uses the knowledge graph to decide where buses should go, based on where people live and where they need to go.
2. From Sansar to the NUM by bus.
3. From Nalaikh to the city center by bus.

Personas:
1. Bayaraa is a transportation planner in Ulaanbaatar.
2. Tsetseg is a 21-year-old student living in Sansar. She goes to NUM mostly every day.
3. Bold is a 62-year-old living in Nalaikh district. He sometimes goes to Ulaanbaatar city center to meet his children

Competency Questions:
1. Bayaraa optimizes a bus route for efficiency and effectiveness.
2. Tsetseg was at her grandparents' house on the weekend. She goes to the university from Yarmag.
3. Bold comes to visit his son who lives in Zaisan.


Personas & Scenarios Definition:

Personas: Transportation planners, Logistics Operators, Passengers.

1.Facility Managers who look after places like airports and train stations. They use the KG to keep track of things like repairs and safety rules.

2.Transportation Planners who plan and improve transportation systems, like bus routes and train schedules, to make them work better for everyone.

3.Logistics operators who manage how things are moved from one place to another, like delivering packages or goods to stores. They use the KG to make sure things are delivered efficiently.

4.Passengers who like you and me who use the KG to find the best way to get from one place to another, like by bus or train


Competency Question Definition :

Passengers Information:

1."What is the fastest way for a traveler to get from location A to location B using public transportation?"
2."What are the upcoming departure times for buses at bus stop X?"
3."Is there a train station within walking distance of my current location?"

Transportation Planning:

4."What are the busiest times for traffic on road W, and how can we alleviate congestion during those times?"
5."How can we optimize bus routes in a city to reduce travel time for passengers?"

Logistics Optimization:

6."What is the most efficient route for a delivery truck to take to deliver packages to multiple locations?"

Emergency Response:

7."What hospitals are closest to an accident, and how fast can an ambulance get there?"
"Is there a clear path for emergency vehicles to reach a specific location?"

Provide comprehensive view of transportation facilities.
Optimize operations.








 The purpose of the knowledge graph (KG) for transportation facilities is to provide a comprehensive view of transportation facilities, manage facilities effectively, analyze traffic patterns, and optimize operations to ensure efficient and seamless transportation services.
